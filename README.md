# Movie-Review-classifier-

This project analyzes the sentiment of film reviews from the IMDB dataset. Using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with LSTM layers, the model classifies reviews as positive or negative. The project involves data preprocessing and training a binary classification model to accurately predict the sentiment of new reviews.

The data set can be found on Kaggle @Sleepytimebaby.
